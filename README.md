# Water-Dispenser-Robot
An autonomous robot with an ultrasonic distance sensor that detects objects around it and dispenses water with the help of a water pump. 
The outcome of the project was on point! Just what i needed. Though, i had to deal with a few water spills because there would some water flowing through the pipe even after you move your bottle away from the sensor. I put a little container at the bottom to collect those few drops of water flowing through the pipe even after moving the water bottle away from the sensor. This was something i expected so, all the design expectations of the robot were met. As an improvement to the project i would, make sure i use plastic to make the body of the robot so it is safe from water spills. I would also work on the water flowing out even after moving the bottle away from the sensor. The water can be pumped back to the water source or even completely avoided from flowing after moving the bottle away from the sensor. I would also incorporate night light using photoresistors so the dispenser can easily be spotted in dark and you can serve yourself without turning the lights on.
